nterprise Campus Network (CCNA Project)
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a complete enterprise-style campus network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network follows a hierarchical architecture (Core, Distribution, Access) and includes VLAN segmentation, Inter-VLAN routing, dynamic routing (OSPF), DHCP, and NAT.
This project simulates a real-world organizational network and showcases practical CCNA-level networking skills.
________________________________________
Network Architecture
The network is designed using the 3-layer hierarchical model:
•	Core Layer → Backbone connectivity (R1)
•	Distribution Layer → Routing and network control (R2, R3)
•	Access Layer → End devices and VLAN segmentation (Switches)
________________________________________
Key Features
•	VLAN segmentation for department separation
•	Inter-VLAN Routing using Router-on-a-Stick
•	OSPF Dynamic Routing for automatic route learning
•	DHCP for automatic IP address assignment
•	NAT (PAT) for internet simulation
•	Hierarchical Campus Network Design
•	End-to-end connectivity testing and troubleshooting

VLAN & Network Plan
VLAN	Department	Network	Gateway
10	HR	192.168.10.0/24	192.168.10.1
20	IT	192.168.20.0/24	192.168.20.1
30	Sales	192.168.30.0/24	192.168.30.1
40	Admin	192.168.40.0/24	192.168.40.1
________________________________________
Routing Protocol
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) was used to enable dynamic routing between core and distribution routers, ensuring automatic route learning and network convergence.
________________________________________
Services Configured
DHCP
Routers were configured as DHCP servers to automatically assign IP addresses, default gateways, and DNS to all VLAN users.
NAT (PAT)
Network Address Translation was configured on the core router to simulate internet access for internal private networks.

Testing & Verification
•	Inter-VLAN communication successful
•	OSPF neighbors formed correctly
•	DHCP assigning IP addresses automatically
•	All VLANs able to communicate across network
•	NAT translation verified using show commands
